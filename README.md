## What is it?

KensurBotMod is a modular Telegram userbot based on KensurBot but stripped down AF, running on Python 3.8+ with an SQLAlchemy database.

Based on [KensurBot](https://github.com/KenHV/KensurBot/tree/sql-extended), [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot) and [ProjectBish](https://github.com/adekmaulana/ProjectBish) userbot.
I made this just for myself with the module that I actually use.
